    let artDescription = "Chihuly's Sconces are wall installations composed of blown-glass elements that are created in responce to a specfic environment. The exterior-lit sculptures are influenced by the chandeliers of the grand homes and palaces throughout Europe from which Chihuly derived inspiration. Chihuly's blown-glass forms vary in color and form and frequently reference the natural world. In Chihuly's Orange and Yellow Hornet Sconce, the elements are referred to as 'hornets' due to their elongated shape, reminiscent of the insect's spiral rear section.\nAround the exterior of the Reflection Room, carefully arranged to complement the Orange and Yellow Hornet Sconce, is the Rising Sun Sconce Wall, composed of eight Sconces. Named for things found in nature, its elements include hornets, feathers, balls, and split leaves."
